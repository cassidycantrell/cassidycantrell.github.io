The first part of the course will examine variables such as out-
put, unemployment, and inflation which are important in examining how 
the economy is doing. Then the course will examine the business cycle:  
why the economy might enter a recession, what policy options the gov-
ernment, including the Federal Reserve, has at its disposal to affect the 
business cycle. After this course, students will be better able to analyze 
economic  discussions  and  have  a  better  comprehension  of  economic 
events as they occur.
